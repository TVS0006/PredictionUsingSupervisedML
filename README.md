# PredictionUsingSupervisedML
Predict the percentage of an student based on the No. of study hours USING Simple Linear Regression by using python

# Simple Linear Regression :
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected
to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression 
task as it involves just two variables.

# Pandas :
pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

# Matplotlib :
Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK.

# sk-learn linear model :
to minimize the residual sum of squares between the observed targets in the dataset, and the targets predicted by the linear approximation.

# sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split :

Split arrays or matrices into random train and test subsets.

Quick utility that wraps input validation, next(ShuffleSplit().split(X, y)), and application to input data into a single call for splitting (and optionally subsampling) data into a one-liner.
